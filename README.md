# ml-algorithms-from-scratch
A collection of Machine Learning Algorithms implemented from scratch


Stuff to improve/add:
1) Implement the best fitting over n fits (least WCSS over n fits) in the KMeans class itself (instead of the testing code)

2) Add comments and explanations for KMeans and Logistic Regression
